== Template clean-up ==
06 Apr 2013 Templates have been cleaned-up and the template directory has been restructured so all user templates are in a subdirectory. Choice of template directory is now switchable, although still in code and not through an options screen.

== Installer Changed ==
21 December 2012 ScriptMind::Links Installer is now protected against re-running and does not need to be deleted from running systems. See Revision r29 

== Smarty Version Changed ==
21 May 2012 ScriptMind::Links now uses [http://www.smarty.net/ Smarty] version 3.1.8. This is a breaking change as templates written for Smarty version 2 may no longer function,

== PHP Version Changed ==
19 May 2012 ScriptMind::Links now uses ADOdb version 517 and as a result requires the PHP version to be at least 5.2
