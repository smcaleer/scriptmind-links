IntSmarty for the Smarty Templating Engine <http://smarty.php.net>

This is a internationalization layer for Smarty written by John
Coggeshall <http://www.coggeshall.org/>. Please consult LICENSE
for terms of use or visit <http://www.coggeshall.org/oss/license.php>
for the license. 

Currently, the only documentation for using IntSmarty is available
in the April, 2004 of php|architect available at <http://www.phparch.com/>.
I plan on writing real docs, but I just don't have time right now.

Please report any bugs to <mailto:john@coggeshall.org>.
